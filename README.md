# ShadyPal
ShadyPal is a straightforward (and mostly useless) tool for generating color palettes from images. Inspect dominant colors from any PNG file and create varied palettes with different levels of saturation, lightness, and shading.
## Features
- Extract (a custom number of) dominant colors from any PNG image (via ColorThief).
- Optional convertion of extracted colors to their pure hue.
- Generate variations in saturation, lightness, and shading for each extracted color.
- Save the resulting palette as a PNG file.
